Tim's Hong Kong Movie Database
==============================

Creating a new database for my Hong Kong movie review site for possible use in a future CMS upgrade on the site.

I recently reinstalled MS Access after 13 years of not using it. People may shit on it but it is good for desktop use for small companies.

Is many different ways to do this I have found out but any solution will be built around my own needs.

Tim.
